== Description ==

Create posts that will only be displayed (and listed in search) for logged in members. Just add the special category Members Only to any post not to be shared publicly. Includes Members Only sidebar widget and Site News widget (all posts not in Members Only category).

There are also members_only and site_news shortcodes for listing headlines on a page or post.

This functionality was originally implemented as part of RSVPMaker for Toastmasters but could be useful for any member-oriented website.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
